# Deep Learning for Social Scientists

University of Oslo, November 27-28, 2024

Reto WÃ¼est

## Course Content

This two-day workshop offers an introduction to deep learning with Python and PyTorch for social scientists. Deep learning is particularly valuable in social science research, enabling the analysis of diverse data types such as time series, text, images, and more.

**Day 1** begins with a high-level overview of machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. Participants will explore the fundamentals of deep learning, including fully connected shallow and deep neural networks as well as techniques for model fitting and evaluating model performance. The session will also briefly introduce the Python programming language and PyTorch, a popular framework for building and training deep learning models. In demo sessions, participants will learn how to implement linear regression, gradient descent, and feed-forward fully connected deep neural networks using Python and PyTorch.

**Day 2** introduces two widely used specialized deep learning architectures: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data and transformers for text data. In demo sessions, participants will learn how to implement these state-of-the-art models using Python and PyTorch.

Upon successful completion of this course, participants should be able to:

- understand some of the deep learning models that are most commonly used in academic research and industry;

- apply these models to real-world data using Python and PyTorch;

- explain the similarities and differences between these models as well as the advantages and disadvantages they have compared to more classical machine learning methods.

## Prerequisites

Participants of this course should have a basic knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, and probability as well as an understanding of "workhorse" statistical models such as linear and logistic regression.

The course will be taught in Python. Prior experience in Python (or another programming language commonly used in machine learning like R) is an advantage but not a requirement.

## Software

This course will use Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colab, so participants will only need a web browser and a Google account.
